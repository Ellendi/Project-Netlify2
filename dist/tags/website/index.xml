      <description>I made this website with my blood, sweat, and tears. No kidding, I freaked out at first because I thought I was doing it wrong but as I went along and began to really look at it. I noticed that nothing was wrong and I was actually doing great. I used Hugo to make my website, Github to place it as a static website, and Notepad++ to edit the md files.</description>
