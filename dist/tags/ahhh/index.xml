      <description>Hello Customer,
I am sorry your site won&amp;rsquo;t build but worry not! I will be here to help you along the way to make sure your site gets built and up and running. One of the most common problems a site will not build is that the theme is incorrect, if you are running a theme that was provide to you from the builder in question. You must first make sure that the folder in which the theme is coming from is spelled exactly correct, when you try to build the website.</description>
