      <description>My favorite thing about technical support is getting a problem that people have been trying to fix for hours, they are at their wits end and have nowhere else to turn to. I try my best to fix the problem. I will research and research. In the end it turns into something simple to fix but it makes the customer so happy. When a customer is happy, I am happy.</description>
