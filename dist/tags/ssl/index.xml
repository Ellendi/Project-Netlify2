      <description>SSL/HTTPS are both important because they are the ways the information between your web browser and website are encrypted. Encryption means security, it gives you the piece of mind that whatever you are researching or looking at is going to be secure from someone coming in and looking at it. While it is not foolproof or the security that ends everything and is the best, it is there and is needed to keep you safe.</description>
