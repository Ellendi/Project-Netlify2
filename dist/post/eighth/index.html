                    <p>Hello Customer,</p>

<p>I am sorry your site won&rsquo;t build but worry not! I will be here to help you along the way to make sure your site gets built
and up and running. One of the most common problems a site will not build is that the theme is incorrect, if you are running
a theme that was provide to you from the builder in question. You must first make sure that the folder in which the theme
is coming from is spelled exactly correct, when you try to build the website. An error will pop-up stating that it cannot
find the theme and will give you the correct spelling of the folder in question, just go in an rename the folder you have
to the folder to what it wants the name to be.</p>

<p>Second issue that it could be is and I know this sounds silly but as with all programming languages you use to build websites
there could be an issue with the code such as an extra # or ; in some place that won&rsquo;t allow the website to be built till this
issue is resolved, please check over your coding and make sure everything is in tip-top shape.</p>

<p>If these two pieces don&rsquo;t resolve your issue please write again and we will brainstorm the issue.</p>
